We will simply make it form the system Components such as Picture Boxes, Timer and Label. We will add our own events to this game.

In this game you will controlling the Helicopter that can move up and down, you can shoot a bullet from the helicopter using the space key. We have reoccurring enemies in this game they will simply come up in different parts of the game and main objective is to shoot them down and score as high as you can. There are pillar to avoid in the game and if you touch them then the game ends and you can restart the game again.
